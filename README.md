GAMEBASE

PHP / MYSQL – VIDEO GAME DATABASE SITE

The idea of this project was to develop a site using HTML, CSS, PHP 7, and MYSQL.
I created a site where users can create an account easily.

FRONT END:
Users can mark and track video games they’ve played, along with their own rating.
They can also mark the completion of Badges: Tasks within games similar to Sony’s Trophy System.
All badges and games the user entered are displayed in the user’s Gamebase.
A user can shape their own database of Custom Badges, which they themselves can add with the front end interface.

All records displayed are specific to the user logged in.

Users are rewarded Experience Points for each Game and Badge they complete and add to their GameBase. Points for badges are awarded based on difficulty of the badge.

BACK END:

I ran a test server using XAMPP on the Windows platform. All pages were built with PHP handling the connections to the database server. All queries to the database were constructed in MYSQL. I developed an admin portion of the site, where admins can create, edit, or delete records in the various database and user tables.

All admin and user pages require correct user / admin logins to order to gain access to any content.
